After completion of these two courses you get a digital specialization label on your University transcript. It is such an amazing course because you get to learn how to use tools like Prezi, Haiku, Google docs, and even Github. You also learn how to create your first app! Which can be used online or even downloaded onto your iPhone/Android. You also learn basic programming using languages such as HTML, Java, CSS, and many more!.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here is the breakdown for the course</p>\r\n<table border=\"1\">\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><b>Assignment Details</b></td>\r\n<td><b>Mark %</b></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Final Project</td>\r\n<td>15%</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Midterm Exam</td>\r\n<td>15%</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Class/Wiki Participation</td>\r\n<td>10%</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Storify the Course</td>\r\n<td>20%</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Final Exam</td>\r\n<td>15%</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p>You can check out the website for more information on how to sign up by <a href=\"http://www.digitalspecialization.ryerson.ca/\">Clicking Here </a>.
